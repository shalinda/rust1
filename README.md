To compile the above Rust code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal or command prompt.

3. Initialize a new Rust project by running the following command:

```
cargo init --bin
```

This will create a new binary project with the necessary files and directories.

4. Open the `Cargo.toml` file in a text editor and add the following dependencies under the `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
actix-web = "4"
rocksdb = "0.19.0"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
bincode = "1.3.3"
```

5. Replace the contents of the `src/main.rs` file with the provided Rust code.

6. Save the changes and compile the project by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```
cargo build
```

This will compile the code and create an executable file in the `target/debug` directory.

7. Once the compilation is successful, you can run the application with the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This will start the Actix Web server, and it should be listening on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

Now, to test the API using `curl`, you can use the following scripts:

**Store an employee**:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "salary": 5000.0}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/employee
```

This will store an employee with ID 1, name "John Doe", and salary 5000.0 in the RocksDB database.

**Retrieve an employee**:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/employee/1
```

This will retrieve the employee with ID 1 and display the JSON response in the terminal.

**Retrieve a non-existent employee**:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/employee/2
```

Since there is no employee with ID 2 in the database, this will return a "404 Not Found" response.

Note that these `curl` commands assume that the server is running on `127.0.0.1:8080`. If you're running the server on a different host or port, adjust the URLs accordingly.
